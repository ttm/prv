1. Intro                                                       *prv-intro*
                                                               *prv-plugins*

PRV is a package, which currently consists of these plugins:
* |prv|, the core: navigation strategies of files, tags and Vim interface.
* |aa|, algorithmic autoregulation: periodic note-taking for dedication
  tracking.
* |realcolors|, 24 bit true color for Vim: on-the-fly tweak your color scheme,
  with persistence and facilities to harness your color settings.
* |tokipona|, for the minimalist conlang Toki Pona: analyses and syntheses
  of texts and of the language itself.
* |bot|, provides interfaces for training populations of bots, for defining corpus and criteria of interest, for talking with the bots, and for obtaining texts from the bots (such as poems and articles).

The long-term goal of |PRV| is to feedback computational intelligence into writting of code and articles.  See Vim ouroboros in [1].  See |prv-intelligence|

See |prv-todo|

1.1. Python, RDF and Vim                                             *PRV*

Harnessing the textual representation of routines and data,
through persistence and selected consideration of excepts,
is exploited in |PRV| by means of Python, RDF, and Vim.
See |prv-python|, |prv-rdf|, and |prv-vim|

One fundamental feature is a periodic interaction with
the |bot|, for note-taking, enriching ongoing work with
reference literature, or interweaving with own dedication
by means of previously taken notes, to which |aa| is dedicated.

Another fundamental feature of |PRV| is a clear strategy
to harness the Wiki and Unix design of hyperlinked text files.
Navigating filenames yield by tokens in the files
is faster, cleaner, and isomorphic to the wiki-like links
such as [[something]], which can be written as something, .something,
../something, something.wiki, or as convenient for the use
and meaning intended.
This is not a trivial issue while not expressed as in |wiki-intro|.

Vim interface:
* C-hjkl for windows in any mode
* A-ad for tabs in any mode (nope. A-a is useful in insert)
* \b\B to open the browser in current dir
* a-b a-B open close Sex in same dir.

File trees:
* see |wiki|

                                                                    *prv-todo*

* make mappings ok:
  - insert should use alt only when not useful if alt==esc.
  - revise them
* revise mappings, commands and mappings and add them to this document.
* publish to vim.org
* Assimilate the aux/experimentalStuff.vim file
* clean .vim/aux vimball stuff
* make bot

Consider |PRV| masks to:
* Social, percolation, participation, etc, Python packges.
* MASS, music
* complex networks
* rendering of imagens and animations
* computational intelligence facilities:
  - start with the vim bot.
    make bigrams and trigrams with aa shouts.
    and with other literature, to mix as convenient.
    make him talk using words in what you say to him.
    make the bot return info about the corpus, e.g. aa shouts.
    the bot gives the aa info window.
    name: lalenia? many names?
    make the bot use dbpedia and other linked data.
    distinguish or not between english and portuguese.
  - add interfaces to ic algorithms published as Python packages.
